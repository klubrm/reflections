When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You may want to use a remote repository if you are interested in sharing your work with others, or are working on something with another developer. This way people have access to what you're working on and can possibly contribute or help.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

One benefit of pulling changes manually allows you the option of disregarding a change that has been made to the remote repository.
